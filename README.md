## üìã Educational Purpose

This site demonstrates several common signs of fraudulent healthcare websites:

1. Unqualified "experts" with dubious credentials
2. Exaggerated claims and statistics
3. Overemphasis on selling products rather than providing care
4. Poor quality or stock images used for facilities and staff
5. Limited or fake contact information

Unlike real scam sites, this parody clearly identifies itself as fake to teach visitors what to look for.

## üîí Privacy

- The visitor counter uses localStorage and does not transmit any data
- No tracking or analytics are implemented
- The contact form is non-functional and for demonstration only
